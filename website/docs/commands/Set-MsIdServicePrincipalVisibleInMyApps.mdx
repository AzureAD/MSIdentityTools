## SYNOPSIS

Toggles whether application service principals are visible when launching myapplications.microsoft.com (MyApps)

## SYNTAX

```powershell
Set-MsIdServicePrincipalVisibleInMyApps [-Visible] <Boolean> [-InFile] <String> [[-OutFile] <String>] [-WhatIf]
 [[-Top] <Int32>] [[-Skip] <Int32>] [[-Continue] <Int32>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

For each provided service principal ID, this cmdlet will add (or remove) the 'HideApp' tag to (or from) its list of tags.

MyApps reads this tag to determine whether to show the service principal in the UX.

-Verbose will give insight into the cmdlet's activities.

Requires Application.ReadWrite.All (to manage service principals), i.e.
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes Application.ReadWrite.All

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1

```powershell
Set-MsIdServicePrincipalVisibleInMyApps -Visible $false -InFile .\sps.txt -OutFile .\output.txt -Verbose
```

Adds the 'HideApp' tag for each Service Principal listed by guid in the sps.txt file.
This ensures that the app is no longer visible in the MyApps portal.

Creates a list of changed SPs, written to output.txt, at the script execution directory.

Provides verbose output to assist with monitoring.

### EXAMPLE 2

```powershell
Set-MsIdServicePrincipalVisibleInMyApps -Visible $true -InFile .\sps.txt -OutFile .\output.txt -Verbose
```

Removes the 'HideApp' tag for each Service Principal listed by guid in the sps.txt file.
This ensures that the app is visible in the MyApps portal.

Creates a list of changed SPs, written to output.txt, at the script execution directory.

Provides verbose output to assist with monitoring.

### EXAMPLE 3

```powershell
Set-MsIdServicePrincipalVisibleInMyApps -Visible $true -InFile .\sps.txt -WhatIf
```

Removes the 'HideApp' tag for each Service Principal listed by guid in the sps.txt file.
This ensures that the app is visible in the MyApps portal.

Provides a 'whatif' analysis to show what would've been updated without the -WhatIf switch.

### EXAMPLE 4

```powershell
Set-MsIdServicePrincipalVisibleInMyApps -Visible $true -InFile .\sps.txt -WhatIf -Top 200
```

Removes the 'HideApp' tag for each Service Principal listed by guid in the sps.txt file.
This ensures that the app is visible in the MyApps portal.

Provides a 'whatif' analysis to show what would've been updated without the -WhatIf switch.
Processes 200 service principals.
